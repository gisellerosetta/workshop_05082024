# workshop_05082024
This is a test repo for the workshop on 05/08/2024. Feel free to try whatever you like!

## Activity:
In main.py, a function called `print_greeting()` is called. This doesn't exist yet.
Our aim is to get this code to run, taking as an input someone's name as a string.

Getting the repo to your computer:
1. Clone the repo using git bash or a command line tool. `git clone link-to-code-here`.
2. Checkout a new branch. git checkout -b "branch-name-here".

Coding:
3. Write a python function in my_module.py to print someone's name. Aim to model this on the 
add_one() function. The output from the function should look something like 'Hello name-here!'.
4. Check it works by saving my_module.py, and running main.py.

Putting the code on the remote repo:
5. Stage your changed file by using `git add my_module.py` on git bash or command line tool.
6. Commit the change with a helpful message. `git commit -m "a message goes here"`
7. Push the changes to a remote branch on the repo. `git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-name`.

Inviting review:
8. On github, open a pull request using the template.

Reviewing:
9. Switch over screen-sharing for someone else to review the code.
10. Check the code against the template, and merge and delete the branch!

Clean up:
The coder can also delete the branch as it exists on their computer:
`git checkout main` to move to the main branch;
`git pull` to pull the now merged changes;
and `git branch -d name-of-branch` to delete the other branch.
